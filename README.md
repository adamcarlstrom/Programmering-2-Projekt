# Programming 2 Project - Multiplayer Snake  

A Java-based multiplayer Snake game where two players compete on the same board. The first player to crash loses!  

## How It Works  
- One player hosts a **server** that others can connect to.  
- Two **clients** join the server and search for a game.  
- Both players control their snakes using **WASD** keys.  
- The game **is not mirrored**, meaning both players see the same screen, but your snake’s color is shown on the right for identification.  

## How to Play  
1. Run `Prog2Projekt.java`.  
2. **Create a server** and then launch two clients.  
3. **Connect the clients** to the server using its IP address.  
4. **Search for a game** to start playing against each other!
